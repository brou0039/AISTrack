# AISTrack
AISTrack is a Proof of Concept made by a group of second year HBO-ICT students at the HZ University of Applied Sciences in Vlissingen, Netherlands.
We are making a system for Zeeland Seaports in Terneuzen. They want to follow ships via AIS in their port.

## Disclaimer

This is a Proof of Concept which means that it's purpose is to demonstrate a certain feature.
The code isn't clean because the aim of a Proof of Concept is not to be easily extendable and such,
like a regular application should.
